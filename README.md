# Win95 Desktop

This repository contains a very minimal mock desktop inspired by the look of Windows 95. It is implemented with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.

To try it out, open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- **Alt+S** â€“ open the Start menu.
- Use **Tab** to focus the Start button, then **Enter** or **Space** to activate it.
